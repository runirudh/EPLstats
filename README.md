# EPLstats - draft 
Multi layer prediction for state change in a soccer match


## Description:

- All soccer matches start at 0-0 goals for each team. 

- Assume Team names to be A & B.

- Starting state for this random phenomenon is (0,0) , from where it can go to state 
  (0,1) or state (1,0) or stay in (0,0) depending on the maximum transition probability 
  (Bayes Decision Rule) out of the 3. 

**Getting these transition probability of changing states is where most of the work 
  needs to be put in.** These probabilities need to be estimated from features that 
  summarize the game situation, team stats (position in table), home/away record,
  how good a team's reaction is after having conceded a goal, etc.
  
- Once we have these transition probabilities, we can fit a big model with mutliple layers
  , where each layer is supplied with the probabilities of state change or state retained, 
  and we simply backpropogate on the most likely path. 
  
- For model architechture a discrete time horizon is applied, which has 6 layers, 
  whose continuous counterpart should be able to tell the state of the game for each minute.

- Predictions are of the nature- 
  given Team A and B are to play, at team A's home ground
  what is the probability that team A scores first, team B scores first, no one scores.
  This gives us the input for our 2nd layer, basically the state of the game after going 
  through the first layer. We apply more layers till we reach end of the game. 
  Useful features for estimating goal scoring probability can be - 
  
  a) team's rank 
  
  b) home/ away record
  
  c) match location
  
  d) goals scored, goals against
  
  e) team wins/loss/draws 
 
  f) team's response to a conceded goal** 
     
     If we have this information we can add rewards to our chain and build a markov decision process problem, 
     & traverse the chain so as to max./min reward.
  
  g) Transfer budget   

Using **data from 2020-21 season** to be able to test our predictions on full range of data.
